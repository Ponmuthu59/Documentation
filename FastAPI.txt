Fast API:

Fast API is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python.It is designed for speed, simplicity, and automatic documentation.


In app Fast API app is the main point of  interaction of application with the client browser.

it return a JSON response.It can return dict, list, string, int, etc.

Unicorn:
FAST API uses this as a server used to listen to client request.
Unlike flask Fast API doesn't contain any built-in development server. So we use Unicorn  to implement ASGI standard and it is Lightning fast. It is Low Latency


Example program:

from fasiapi FASTAPI
app.get=FastAPI()
@app("/")
def root():
	return{"message" : "hello-world"}

o/p:
{"message" : "hello-world"}

ReDoc
ReDoc is an auto-generated API documentation tool in FastAPI, built using OpenAPI (Swagger). It provides a clean, user-friendly UI for exploring and testing API endpoints.

Fastapi uses async so it will be faster than the other frameworks like flask,Django.
